# ARMDeviceDrivers


This repo contains all the drivers I've written for the below list :

1) Analog-to-Digital Converter drivers
2) PWM drivers 
3) UART drivers 
4) TIMER drivers
5) Interrupt drivers
6) GPIO drivers


The GPIO driver is to drive the LED on Port A Pin 5 and then related operations with the LED.

# Note

I suggest if you're interested to follow along, refer the Driver Dev section in the ARM Assembly notes upload :)


# Toolkits/Boards 

1) Keil uVision 5 IDE
2) STM32F411-NUCLEO/STM32F4-DISCOVERY
