# ARMDeviceDrivers


This repo contains all the drivers I've written for the below list :

1) Analog-to-Digital Converter drivers
2) PWM drivers 
3) UART drivers 
4) TIMER drivers
5) Interrupt drivers
6) GPIO drivers


Our Simpler project includes GPIODriver 1,2,3 are Output Drivers (where we turn on the LED and also toggle it to make it blink) and GPIODriver 4 is the Input Driver (where we drive a LED using the onboard push button)

# Note

I suggest if you're interested to follow along, refer the Driver Dev section in the ARM Assembly notes upload :)


# Toolkits/Boards 

1) Keil uVision 5 IDE
2) STM32F411-NUCLEO/STM32F4-DISCOVERY
